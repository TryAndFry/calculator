Basic calculator build as a project during the curriculum for The Odin Project.
This is a "European" style calculator that uses commas rather than periods to represent decimals. This was a personal choice to make this project more challenging with string manipulations and number conversions.
The code is pretty janky, and it could definitely be improved with better data structures. However, it seems as though TOP wanted explicit use of Arrays for this project, so that's what was used.
Currently, the operations only work with the numberpad entries. This could be improved upon to use the secondy inputs of the digit keys, but that was left out of this project as it seems implementation would be trivial.
Floating point error is also an issue with this implementation, but that correction also seems trivial with EPSILON comparison implementation.
This project was also coded to emulate odler style calcultors that had a finite number of digits to display the result.
